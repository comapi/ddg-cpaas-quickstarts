# Facebook Quick Start Tutorial
This quick start tutorial shows you how to add the **Send to Messenger** web plugin to an Express web site, and then subsequently use the Comapi "One" API to send messages via Facebook. This is a very basic example but demonstrates the core steps required to use Facebook in your web sites and systems.

See [our docs](http://docs.comapi.com) for more information.
